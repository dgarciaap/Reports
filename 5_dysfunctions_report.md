I learned a lot of things from this book. First, that obvious and simple things always seem *not-so-obvious* when something is going in the wrong direction. When this happens, the team needs to take a step back and get on the same page, only then they can **establish the needed goals and work towards them.**

The author explains the typical behavior of a dysfunctional team in five aspects:

1. **Absence of trust among team members:** it comes from not being able to show vulnerability within your team. I think this is the most important aspect because trust becomes key when communicating. You need to trust your teammate in order to know you things will work out and you can communicate any issue there may be.
2. **Fear of conflict:** when there’s no trust between the members of a team, it is really difficult to engage in unfiltered debate. 
3. **Lack of commitment:** since there was not a passionate debate, teammates usually hold their real opinions and not only this becomes risky but the most important thing is that they don’t commit to the project and don’t put effort into it.
4. **Avoidance of accountability:** if teammates don’t have the three characteristics from above, they don’t really value the project. Therefore, calling out actions that may be affecting the team can become a difficult task for them. 
5. **Inattention to results:** when there’s not a common goal defined, then people seek out for their own. These goals can be self-recognition, career development or simply their ego, and when a member of a group is focused on this, the project’s output won’t be good. 

What surprised me the most was the way this book goes along with “The Growth Mindset” one. It talks about how a teammate's ego (to seek out individual recognition and attention at the expense of results) can go terribly. 

I think reading these two books has become a great combo. I have learned how to act on my own when achieving goals and now I can apply them on teamwork. Setting team goals and identifying when we are achieving them and if not, what we can inspect and change in order to make it. 

What I’ll be doing differently now is having in mind the five dysfunctions of a team and when working in one, to look for them in order to eradicate these bad practices.
