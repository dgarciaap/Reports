What I learned from this book could be written in one sentence: *growth is always possible through effort*. Developing a positive mindset towards challenges and new ideas can introduce you, and the people you interact with, to many new opportunities. 

I can say I see myself represented in both mindsets: the fixed and the growth. I think it is a human thing to be afraid of challenging tasks and the negative labels people, or even yourself, could put on you from the output of these tasks. But having these characteristics will, definitely, **limit your achievements**.

I’ve been doubtful about taking risks and challenges but I’ve always pushed myself to go that extra mile and see if I can make it. This book gave me the self-confidence I needed to remind myself that it’s okay if the output is not the one I was expecting. To learn from failure and see what you can do with it, it’s not always black and white (**Treating setbacks as opportunities to learn from**). 

One thing that surprised me was how easy it is for kids to develop a fixed mindset if the environment they grow up in is not the appropriate one. It made me think about how important it is, for us humans, to **create and keep favorable and safe environments for people to grow**.

But what surprised me the most was the simplicity of the process to start the journey of transforming your mindset. It is a long but wonderful one. I’m motivated and I already started working on it and share it with the people I interact with on a daily basis.

I don’t mean to sound **dramatic**, but this book may have changed my life. I have identified my fixed persona, named it and now I’m aware of the triggers it pulls in different situations and planned the *strategies* I can follow to diminish them. 

The most valuable thing this book gifted me was that sense of *self-awareness*. It made me realize my present state in order to develop habits and strategies to grow and, hopefully, make others grow too in the future.
